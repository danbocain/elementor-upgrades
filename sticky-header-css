/*ADD THIS CODE TO YOUR ELEMENTOR HEADER CSS

INSTRUCTIONS
Build your header in Elementor as you normally would.  Set your section to sticky under Advanced. Set Effects Offset to 1. This allows us to change the color on scroll, otherwise the new sticky would take effect incorrectly for what we want to do

Set the Z-index of your header section to a number higher than any z-index of your page content (I used 5 for the tutorial)

Set your header's BOTTOM margin to a negative value that matches the overall height of your header (before sticky).  Mine was -140px:

To ensure we can easily edit our content in Elementor afterwards we can add some extra CSS.  This will revert the header back to it&#8217;s normal placement only in the editor (it will not affect the front-end)

/* Background color on sticky */
.elementor-sticky--effects {
background-color:rgba(255,255,255,0.85);
transition: all 0.5s ease;
}

/* --- LOGO ---- */
/* Logo sizing before sticky */
.logo img {
width: auto;
max-height: 120px;
transition: all 0.5s ease;
}

/* Logo sizing after sticky */
.elementor-sticky--effects .logo img {
max-height: 65px;
width: auto;
}
